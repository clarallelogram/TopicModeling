Dataset Files:

The first cell in the google colab notebook contain URLs for direct download of the CSV files of the dataset. These files must be downloaded and saved to one's google drive to be able to run the code as using wget to download the files with their URLs was not working. 

Theory Notes: 

This is a file that contains notes on theory behind topic modeling and how some of the algorithms discussed work as well as what computations occur behind the scenes.
